        <h2 class="section-title">Norse mythology</h2>

        <article class="section-content">
          <p class="noto-serif"><span class="fancy">N</span>orse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition.</p>

          <p class="noto-serif"><span class="fancy">N</span>umerous gods are mentioned in the source texts such as the hammer-wielding, humanity-protecting god Thor, who relentlessly fights his foes; the one-eyed, raven-flanked god Odin, who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the runic alphabet; the beautiful, seiðr-working, feathered cloak-clad goddess Freyja who rides to battle to choose among the slain; the vengeful, skiing goddess Skaði, who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore; the powerful god Njörðr, who may calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land; the god Freyr, whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity; the goddess Iðunn, who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness; the mysterious god Heimdallr, who is born of nine mothers, can hear grass grow, has gold teeth, and possesses a resounding horn; the jötunn Loki, who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death of the goddess Frigg's beautiful son Baldr; and numerous other deities.</p>

          <p class="noto-serif"><span class="fancy">M</span>ost of the surviving mythology centers on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as humanity and the jötnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes and/or family members of the gods. The cosmos in Norse mythology consists of Nine Worlds that flank a central cosmological tree, Yggdrasil. Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings. Various forms of a creation myth are recounted, where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two humans are Ask and Embla. These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of Ragnarök, when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies, and the world is enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. There the surviving gods will meet, and the land will be fertile and green, and two humans will repopulate the world.</p>

          <p class="noto-serif"><span class="fancy">N</span>orse mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since the 17th century, when key texts were brought to the attention of the intellectual circles of Europe. By way of comparative mythology and historical linguistics, scholars have identified elements of Germanic mythology reaching as far back as Proto-Indo-European mythology. In the modern period, the Romanticist Viking revival re-awoke an interest in the subject matter, and references to Norse mythology may now be found throughout modern popular culture. The myths have further been revived in a religious context among adherents of Germanic Neopaganism.</p>

<h2 class="header-color"> Goals </h2>
<p> Technology has always fascinated me. This is partly depedented
   on the amazing age of technology we are currently in. As as kid,
    I had the Nintendo 64, now i have a PC with 10 times the power the
    Nintendo had. My point is, I have seen the an amazing leap foward in
    technology first hand. My main goal is to the contribute to the ground
    breaking innovation that is constantly present in the tech industry.
   One of my personal favorite projects is HeatSync, a project that is
  helping people in New York with cold and even hot temperatures inside
 of their apartments. I think this a perfect example of how technology,  in particular programming, can come up with new innovative ways to increase the standard of living.
    Also, I love to create things from nothing. The feeling of taking scratch
    and turning it into a helpful product is truly incredible. I also love how
     new languages and technologies can actually push the boundaries of what
     can be built. I hope to captilize on the innovative, constantly adavancing
      tech industry to accomplish these goals.
